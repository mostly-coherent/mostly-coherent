# Hi, I'm JM 👋

I code agentically to gain clarity and depth on anything I tackle, then ship what works. **Strategy is intent; code is reality**—that's why I build to validate, not theorize. I use data when the path is unclear and trust judgment when it's time to act.

### 💼 What I'm Building

Director at Adobe Commerce, building a baseline suite of interactive prototypes that collectively represent the entire commerce platform and customer experiences. This enables teams to adopt prototype-first product development—exploring workflows through working examples, instead of parsing documentation. I saw teams internalize patterns faster when they can interact with prototypes. That's why I'm now helping teams code their way to certainty before committing at scale—keeping AI use principled and responsible in real-world systems.

Work repos are internal to Adobe, but here's what I can share: **[Helpful Prompts](https://github.com/mostly-coherent/Helpful-Prompts)** captures some of the workflows and frameworks I use—adapted so they're infrastructure-agnostic and immediately useful. I value meaningful exchanges—let's trade notes on agentic workflows or what you're building with AI.

### 🧪 What Else I'm Building

Outside of work, I'm focused on steering AI to shape the next generation. The goal: help young people become critical thinkers with grit, life skills, and the wisdom to use AI safely—not as a shortcut that weakens judgment or self-reliance. I build with my kids first (music, sports, arts, literature, science). It's a work in progress.

**[Sandlot Wisdom](https://github.com/mostly-coherent/Sandlot-Wisdom)** — I'm learning baseball alongside my son. The Peanuts theme wasn't just decoration; it reframed "I don't know baseball" from embarrassing to endearing.  
*Next up: Ambient listening for backyard games—tracking scores from natural conversation.*

**[Dad Aura](https://github.com/mostly-coherent/dad-aura)** — Real-time aura scoring from my son's Apple Watch. What surprised me: him controlling score "flips" created more engagement than the scoring itself.  
*Next up: AI guardrails that know when to say no and nurture healthy values.*

**[Allegro](https://github.com/mostly-coherent/Allegro)** — A music practice companion to cultivate the love for music. I learned that audio recognition trained on studio recordings fails completely when kids stop + repeat mid-phrase and play wrong notes.  
*Next up: Real-time "play along" suggestions so I can jam with my kids on guitar.*

**[LifeSynced](https://github.com/mostly-coherent/LifeSynced)** — Unified calendar with a privacy-first design. The "[Personal Event]" placeholder with password reveal made it safe to demo to any audience.  
*Next up: An AI agent that proactively reminds and helps plan the important life events.*

### 🛠️ Stack

**Cursor + Claude** (Opus for coding, Sonnet for writing) — I focus on product requirements and architectural decisions; Cursor handles syntax and implementation patterns. This workflow lets me build at the speed of thought, iterate based on actual use.

For implementation, I use **Next.js, TypeScript, Python, PostgreSQL, Vercel**—guided by Opus based on latest best practices. For agent architecture: **LangChain + MCP**. Framework choices matter less than shipping validated solutions quickly.
