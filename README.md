# Hi, I'm JM 👋

I value simplicity, but earn it through rigor—data when it matters, judgment when it's time to act. Strategy is intent; code is reality. That's why I code agentically: to comprehend problems deeply, then validate by shipping what works.

### 💼 What I'm Building

Director at Adobe Commerce, building an interactive prototype library for agentic development—making the commerce platform explorable so others can reason with it through working examples, codifying monetization expertise, and evangelizing AI-first PM craft at enterprise scale. 

Work repos are internal, but I share what I can here. **[Helpful Prompts](https://github.com/mostly-coherent/Helpful-Prompts)** has prompts and workflows from my work, adapted so they're not Adobe infra-specific. Happy to discuss what you're building.

### 🧪 What Else I'm Building

Outside of work, I'm focused on how AI shapes the next generation. The goal: helping young people become critical thinkers, ferocious readers, introspective creators, inquisitive researchers, articulate communicators—learners with grit, life skills, and the wisdom to use AI safely, not as a shortcut that weakens judgment or self-reliance. I build with my kids first, creating an ecosystem around music, sports, arts, literature, and science. This is a work in progress, an ongoing journey.

**[Nutty Baseball](https://github.com/mostly-coherent/nutty_baseball)** — I'm learning baseball alongside my son. The Peanuts theme wasn't just decoration; it reframed "I don't know baseball" from embarrassing to endearing.  
*Next up: Ambient listening for backyard games—tracking scores from natural conversation.*

**[Dad Aura](https://github.com/mostly-coherent/dad-aura)** — Real-time aura scoring from my son's Apple Watch. What surprised me: him controlling score "flips" created more engagement than the scoring itself.  
*Next up: AI guardrails that know when to say no and nurture healthy values.*

**[Allegro](https://github.com/mostly-coherent/Allegro)** — A music practice companion. I learned that audio recognition trained on studio recordings fails completely when kids stop mid-phrase and play wrong notes.  
*Next up: Real-time "play along" suggestions so I can jam with my kids on guitar.*

**[LifeSynced](https://github.com/mostly-coherent/LifeSynced)** — Unified calendar with a privacy-first design. The "[Personal Event]" placeholder with password reveal made it safe to demo to any audience.  
*Next up: An AI agent that proactively reminds and helps plan the important life events.*

### 🛠️ Stack

Next.js, TypeScript, Python. PostgreSQL for data, Vercel for infrastructure. Cursor + LangChain + MCP for agents. The tools matter less than the mindset—I pick what lets me move fast and produce impact.
